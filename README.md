# The Reiner SCT One Time Password Library for Ruby

A ruby library for generating and validating one time passwords (TOTP only) according to [RFC 6238](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

RSCT_OTP is compatible with [Google Authenticator](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator) available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) and any other TOTP based implementations.

## Dependencies

* OpenSSL
* Ruby 2.5 or higher

## Installation

Build and install the gem into your project.

```bash
gem build rsct_otp
gem install rsct_otp-1.0.0.gem
```

## Library Usage

### Time based OTP's

```ruby
totp = RSCT_OTP::TOTP.new("base32secret3232", issuer: "My Service")
totp.now # => "492039"

# OTP verified for current time - returns timestamp of the current interval
# period.
totp.verify("492039") # => 1474590700

# OTP fails to verify - returns nil
totp.verify("492039") # => nil
```

### Preventing reuse of Time based OTP's

By keeping track of the last time a user's OTP was verified, we can prevent token reuse during
the interval window (default 30 seconds)

The following is an example of this in action:

```ruby
user = User.find(someUserID)
totp = RSCT_OTP::TOTP.new(user.otp_secret)
totp.now # => "492039"

# Let's take a look at the last time the user authenticated with an OTP
user.last_otp_at # => 1432703530

# Verify the OTP
last_otp_at = totp.verify("492039", after: user.last_otp_at) #=> 1472145760
# RSCT_OTP returns the timestamp(int) of the current period

# Store this on the user's account
user.update(last_otp_at: last_otp_at)

# Someone attempts to reuse the OTP inside the 30s window
last_otp_at = totp.verify("492039", after: user.last_otp_at) #=> nil
# It fails to verify because we are still in the same 30s interval window
```

### Verifying a Time based OTP with drift

Some users may enter a code just after it has expired. By adding 'drift' you can allow
for a recently expired token to remain valid.

```ruby
totp = RSCT_OTP::TOTP.new("base32secret3232")
now = Time.at(1474590600) #2016-09-23 00:30:00 UTC
totp.at(now) # => "250939"

# OTP verified for current time along with 15 seconds earlier
# ie. User enters a code just after it expired
totp.verify("250939", drift_behind: 15, at: now + 35) # => 1474590600
# User waits too long. Fails to validate previous OTP
totp.verify("250939", drift_behind: 15, at: now + 45) # => nil
```

### Generating a Base32 Secret key

```ruby
RSCT_OTP::Base32.random  # returns a 160 bit (32 character) base32 secret. Compatible with Google Authenticator
```

Note: The Base32 format conforms to [RFC 4648 Base32](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#RFC_4648_Base32_alphabet)

### Generating QR Codes for provisioning mobile apps

Provisioning URI's generated by RSCT_OTP are compatible with most One Time Password applications, including
Google Authenticator.

```ruby
totp = RSCT_OTP::TOTP.new("base32secret3232", issuer: "My Service")
totp.provisioning_uri("alice@google.com") # => 'otpauth://totp/My%20Service:alice@google.com?secret=base32secret3232&issuer=My%20Service'
```

This can then be rendered as a QR Code (e.g. by rqrcode library) which the user can scan using their mobile phone and the appropriate application.

### Testing

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```
